bigger majority Mr leader you're the

majority leader

about that much bigger

yeah well I tell you what I want to give

special recognition to someone who I

think is going to be considered the

greatest speaker in the history of the

House of Representative Nancy Pelosi

foreign

folks the story of America is a story of

progress and resilience

of always moving forward of never ever

giving up

is a story unique among all nations

we're the only country that has emerged

from every crisis we've ever entered

stronger than we got into it look folks

that's what we're doing again

two years ago the economy was Reeling I

stand here tonight after we've created

with the help of many people in this

room

12 million new jobs more jobs created in

two years than any prisons created in

four years because of you all because of

the American people

two years ago

and two years ago

covet had shut down our businesses were

closed our schools were robbed of so

much and today covert no longer controls

Our Lives and two years ago democracy

faces greatest threat to the Civil War

and today though bruised our democracy

remains unbowed and Unbroken

As We Gather here tonight

we're writing the next chapter in The

Great American story the story of

progress and resilience

when world leaders asked me to Define

America and they do believe it or not

exciting to find it in one word and I

mean this possibilities

we don't think anything is beyond our

capacity everything is a possibility

you know we're often told that Democrats

and Republicans can't work together but

over the past two years we've proved the

cynics and naysayers wrong

yes we disagreed plenty and yes there

were times when Democrats went alone

but time and again Democrats and

Republicans came together came together

to defend us stronger and safer Europe

it came together the past one in the Gen

one in the generation once in the

generation infrastructure law Building

Bridges connecting our nation and our

people we came together to pass the most

significant law ever helping victims

expose the toxic burn pits and in fact

foreign

in fact

I signed over 300

bipartisan pieces of legislation since

becoming president from reauthorizing

the violence guns women act the

Electoral count Reform Act the respect

for marriage act that protects the right

to marry the person you love and to my

Republican friends if we could work

together the last Congress there's no

reason we can't work together and find

consensus on important things in this

Congress as well

I think

folks

you all are as formed as I am but I

think the people sent us a clear message

fighting for the sake of fighting power

for the sake of power Conflict for the

sake of conflict gets us nowhere

that's always been my vision of our

country and I know it's many viewers to

restore the soul of this nation to

rebuild the backbone of America

America's middle class and to unite the

country

we've been sent here to finish the job

in my view

for decades the middle class has been

hollowed out in more than and not know

one Administration but for a long time

too many good pain manufacturing jobs

move overseas factories closed down once

thriving cities and towns that many of

you represent became Shadows of what

they used to be

and along the way something else we lost

Pride our sense of self-worth

I ran for president to fundamentally

change things to make sure our economy

works for everyone so we can all feel

that pride in what we do

to build an economy from the bottom up

in the middle out

not from the top down because when the

middle class does well the poor have a

ladder up and the wealthy still do very

well we all do well

I know a lot of you always kidding me

for always quoting my dad but my dad

used to say Joey and jobs a bottle a lot

more than a paycheck because he really

would say this it's about a lot more

than a paycheck it's about your dignity

it's about respect it's about being able

to look your kid in the eye and say

honey it's going to be okay and mean it

folks

so let's look at the results

we're not finished yet by any stretch of

the imagination but unemployment rate is

at 3.4 percent a 50-year low

record

Premier record unemployment

near record unemployment for Black and

Hispanic workers we've already created

your help eight hundred thousand good

paying manufacturing jobs the fastest

growth in 40 years

and where is it written

where is it written that America can't

lead the world in manufacturing I don't

know where that's written

for too many decades we imported

projects and exported jobs

now thanks to what you've all done we're

exporting American products and creating

American jobs

folks inflation

inflation has been a global problem

because the pandemic disrupted our

supply chains and Putin's unfair and

brutal war in Ukraine disrupted energy

supplies as well as Food Supplies

blocking all that grain in Ukraine but

we're a better position than any country

on Earth right now but we have more to

do but here at home inflation is coming

down here at home gas prices are down a

dollar fifties from their Peak food

inflation is coming down not fast enough

but coming down inflation is falling

every month for the last six months or

take-home pay has gone up

additionally over the last two years a

record 10 million Americans apply to

start new businesses 10 million

and by the way

every time someone starts a small

business is an act of Hope

and Madam vice president I want to thank

you for leading that effort to ensure

the small businesses have access to

Capital

and the historic laws reenact it that

are going to just come into being

standing here this year I shared with

you a story

of American genius and possibilities

semiconductors

small computer chips the size of a

fingerprint that power everything from

cell phones to Automobiles and so much

more

these chips were invented in America

let's get that straight they were

invented in America

because we used to make 40 percent of

the world's chips

in the last several decades we lost our

Edge we're down only producing 10

percent

we all saw what happened during the

pandemic when chip factories shut down

overseas today's automobiles need 3 000

chips each of those automobiles

but American automobiles couldn't make

enough cars because there weren't enough

chips

car prices went up people got laid off

so did everything from refrigerators to

cell phones

we can never let that happen again

that's why

that's why we came together to pass the

bipartisan chips and science Act

[Music]

folks

I know I've been criticized for saying

this but I'm not changing my view

we're going to make sure the supply

chain for America begins in America the

supply chain begins in America

we've already created

you've already traded

800 000 new manufacturing jobs without

this law before the law get kicks in

with this new law we're going to create

hundreds of thousands of new jobs across

the country I mean all across the

country throughout not just the coast

but through the middle of the country as

well

that's going to come from companies that

have announced more than 300 billion

dollars in investment in American

manufacturing over the next few years

outside of Columbus Ohio Intel is

building semiconductor factories on a

thousand acres literally a Field of

Dreams it's going to create ten thousand

jobs that one investment

seven thousand construction jobs

three thousand jobs in those factories

once they're finished they call them

factors

jobs paying an average of a hundred and

thirty thousand dollars a year and many

do not require a college degree

some jobs

because we work together these jobs

where people don't have to leave home to

search for opportunity

and it's just getting started

think about the new homes the small

businesses the big the medium-sized

businesses so much more that's going to

be needed to support those three

thousand those three thousand permanent

jobs

and the factors that are going to be

built

talk to Mayors and governors Democrats

and Republicans and they'll tell you

what this means for their communities

we're seeing these Field of Dreams

transform to the heartland

but to maintain the strongest economy in

the world we need the best

infrastructure in the world

oh no

we used to be number one in the world in

infrastructure

we've sunk to 13th in the world the

United States of America

13th in the world and infrastructure

modern infrastructure but now we're

coming back because we came together and

passed a bipartisan infrastructure law

the largest investment infrastructure

since President Eisenhower's interstate

highway system

and folks

already we've funded over 20 000

projects including major airports from

Boston to Atlanta to Portland projects

are going to put thousands of people to

work rebuilding our highways our bridges

our railroads our tunnels ports airports

clean water high-speed internet all

across America Urban rural tribal and

folks we're just getting started we're

just getting started

and I mean it sincerely

I want to thank my Republican friends

who voted for the law

and my Republican friends who voted

against it as well

but I'm still I I still get asked to

fund the projects in those districts as

well but don't worry

I promise I'd be a president for all

Americans we'll fund these projects and

I'll see you at the groundbreaking

look

this law

the throttle further United all of

America projects like Brent spread

bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio river

built 60 years ago badly needed repairs

one of the nation's most congested

Freight routes carrying two billion

dollars worth of freight every single

day across the Ohio River and folks I've

been talking about fixing it for decades

but we're really finally going to get it

done

I went there last month with Democrats

and Republicans and from both states to

deliver a commitment of 1.6 billion

dollars for this project

[Applause]

we share tonight I don't know where

Sarah is the ship in the Box I don't

know Sarah how are you

well Sarah for 30 years

for 30 years

I learned she told me she'd been a proud

member of the Iron Workers Local 44

known as

known as the Cowboys in the sky

the folks who built

built Cincinnati skyline Sarah said she

can't wait to be 10 stories above the

Ohio River Building that new bridge God

bless her

that's pride and that's where also

building we're building back Pride

look we're also replacing poisonous lead

pipes that go into 10 million homes in

America

400 000 school and Child Care Centers so

every child in America

every child American drink the water

instead of having permanent damage to

their brain

look

we're making sure

we're making sure

that every community

every community in America has access to

Affordable high-speed internet no

parents should have to drive by

McDonald's parking lot to help to do

their farm work online or their kids

which many thousands were doing across

the country

and when we do these projects

and again I get criticized this if I

make no excuses for it we're going to

buy American we're going to buy America

folks

and it's totally is totally consistent

with International Trade rules

buy America has been the law since 1933

but for too long past administrations

Democrat and Republican have fought to

get around it not anymore

tonight I'm announcing new standards

require all construction materials used

in federal infrastructure projects to be

made in America

made in America

I mean it

Lumber glass drywall fiber optic cable

and I might watch American roads Bridges

American highways are going to be made

with American Products as well folks

my economic plan is about investing in

places and people that have been

forgotten

so many of you listen to me tonight

I know you feel it

so many of you felt like you've just

simply been forgotten

people of the past four decades

too many people have been left behind

and treated like they're invisible

maybe that's you watching from home

remember the jobs that went away you

remember them don't you

the folks at home remember them

you wonder whether the path even exists

anymore for your children to get ahead

without having to move away

well that's why I get that

that's why we're building an economy

where no one's left behind

jobs are coming back pride is coming

back

because choices we made in the last

several years

you know

this is my view of blue collar blueprint

to rebuild America make a real

difference in your lives at home

for example

too many of you

lay in bed at night like my dad did

staring at the ceiling wondering

wouldn't God names happens if your

spouse gets cancer

or your child gets deadly ill

or something happens to you

what are you going to get money to pay

for those medical bills are you going to

have to sell the house or try to get a

second mortgage on it

I get it I get it

with inflation reduction act that I

signed into law

we're taking on powerful interest to

bring health care costs down

so you can sleep better at night

with more security

you know we pay more for prescription

drugs than any nation in the world let

me say it again we pay more for

prescription drugs than any major Nation

on Earth

for example

one in ten Americans has diabetes many

of you in this chamber do and then the

audience

but every day Millions need insulin to

control their diabetes

so they can literally stay alive

insulin's been around for over a hundred

years

the guy invented didn't even patent him

because he wanted to be available for

everyone

it costs the drug companies roughly

ten dollars a vial to make that insulin

packaging and all you may get up to

thirteen dollars

but big Pharma has been unfairly

charging people hundreds of dollars four

to five hundred dollars a month

making record profits not anymore

not anymore

so many so many things that we did are

only now coming to fruition

we said we were doing this and we said

we passed the law to do it but people

didn't know because the law didn't take

effect until January 1 of this year

we capped the cost of insulin at 35 a

month for seniors on Medicare

people are just finding out

I'm sure you're getting the same calls

I'm getting

look there are millions of other

Americans

who do not or are not on Medicare

including two hundred thousand young

people

with type 1 diabetes and in these

needless insulin to stay alive

let's finish the job this time let's cap

the cost of instance for everybody at 35

dollars

folks

the big Farmer's still going to do very

well I promise you all I promise you

they're going to do very well

this also this law also caps and won't

go into effect until 2025.

cost out-of-pocket drug costs for

seniors on Medicare at a maximum of two

thousand dollars a year you don't have

to pay more than two thousand dollars no

matter how much your drug costs are

because you know why you all know it

many of you like many of my family have

cancer

you know the drugs can range from 10 11

14 15 000 for the Cancer drugs

now drug prices rise faster than

inflation drug companies are going to

have to pay Medicare back the difference

or finally

we're finally giving Medicare the power

to negotiate drug prices

bringing down

bringing down prescription drug costs

doesn't just save seniors money

cuts the federal deficit by billions of

dollars

by hundreds of billions of dollars

because these prescription drugs

are drugs purchased by Medicare to make

keep their commitment to the seniors

well guess what

instead of paying four or five hundred

bucks a month you're paying 15. that's a

lot of savings for the federal

government

and by the way why wouldn't we want that

now some members here are threatening

and I know it's not a official party

position so I'm not I'm going to

exaggerate

but certainly to repeal the inflation

reduction Act

as my coach

that's okay that's fair

as my football coach used to say lots of

luck in your senior year

make no mistake

if you try anything to raise the cost of

producing jobs I will veto it

look

I'm pleased to say the more Americans

helpful to have health insurance now

than ever in history a record 16 million

people are enrolled in the Affordable

Care Act and thanks

thanks for the law I signed last year

saving millions of saving 800 a year on

their premiums by the way that law was

written

and the benefit expires in 2025.

so my plea to some of you at least in

this audience let's finish the job and

make these savings permanent

expand coverage on Medicaid

look

the inflation reduction Act is also the

most significant investment ever in

climate change

ever

lower utility bill created American jobs

leading the world to a clean energy

future I visited the devastating

aftermath of record floods droughts

storms and wildfires from Arizona New

Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian

border

more Timber has been burned as I've

observed from helicopters than the

entire state of Missouri

and we don't have global warming not a

problem

in addition to emergency recovery from

Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho we're

rebuilding for the long term

new electric grids that are able to

weather major storms and not prevent

those forest fires roads and Water

Systems withstand the next big flood

clean energy to cut pollution and create

jobs and communities often left behind

we're going to build 500 000 electric

vehicle charging stations installed

that'll cross the country by tens of

thousands of IBEW workers

and

we're helping families save more than a

thousand dollars a year with tax credits

to purchase electric vehicles and

efficient and efficient appliances

energy efficient appliances

historic conservation efforts to be

responsible stewards of our land

let's face reality

the climate crisis doesn't care if

you're in a red or blue state

it's an existential threat

we have an obligation not to ourselves

but our children or grandchildren to

confront it

I'm proud of how the how America at last

is stepping up to the challenge

we're still going to need oil and gas

for a while

but guess what no we do

but there's so much more to do

we got to finish the

we pay for these investments in our

future by finally making the wealthiest

and biggest corporations begin to pay

their fair share

look I'm a capitalist

I'm a capitalist but pay your fair share

I think a lot of you at home

a lot of you at home agree with me and

many people that you know

the tax system is not fair it is not

fair

look

the idea

that in 2020

55 of the largest corporation in America

the fortune 500. made 40 billion dollars

in profits and paid zero in federal

taxes

zero

folks it's simply not fair

but now because of the law I signed

billion dollar companies have to pay a

minimum of 15 God loved them

50 percent

that's less than a nurse pays

let me be crystal clear I said at the

very beginning under my plans as long as

I'm president nobody earning less than

four hundred thousand dollars will pay

an additional penny in taxes nobody not

one penny

so let's finish the job there's more to

do foreign

we have to reward work not just wealth

passed my proposal for the billionaire

minimum tax

you know there's a thousand billionaires

in America it's up from about 600 in the

beginning of time

but no billionaire should be paying a

lower tax rate than the school teacher

or firefighter

I mean it think about it

I mean look

I know all yarn are enthusiastic about

that but think about it

think about it

have you noticed Big Oil just reported

as profits record profits

last year they made

200 billion dollars in the midst of a

global energy crisis

I think it's outrageous

why they invested too little of that

profit to increase domestic production

and when I talked to a couple of them

they say we were afraid you're going to

shut down all the oil wells and all the

oil refineries anyway so why should we

invest in them I said we're going to

need oil for at least another decade

and that's going to exceed

and beyond that

we're going to need it

production

if they had in fact invested in the

production to keep gas prices down

instead they use the record profits to

buy back their own stock

rewarding the CEOs and shareholders

corporations ought to do the right thing

that's why I propose we quadruple the

tax on corporate stock BuyBacks and

occurs long long-term Investments

let's finish the job and close the

loophole to allow very wealthy to avoid

paying their taxes instead of cutting

the number of orders for wealthy

taxpayers I just signed a law to reduce

the deficit by 114 billion dollars by

cracking down on Wealthy tax sheets

[Applause]

my Administration has cut the deficit

why more than

1.7 trillion dollars

the largest deficit reduction in

American history

under the previous administration the

American deficit went up four years in a

row

because those record deficits no

president added more to the national

debt

in any four years than my predecessor

nearly 25 percent of the entire national

debt that took over 200 years to

accumulate was added by just one

Administration alone the last one

they're the facts check it out

check it out

[Applause]

how did Congress respond to that debt

they did the right thing they left at

the debt ceiling three times without

preconditions or crisis

they paid American bills to prevent an

economic disaster in the country so

tonight I'm asking the Congress to

follow suit

let's commit here tonight to the full

faith and credit of the United States of

America will never ever be questioned

so my many of some of my Republican

friends

want to take the economy hostage I get

it unless I agree to the economic plans

all of you at home should know what

those plans are

instead of making the wealthy pay their

fair share some Republicans some

Republicans want Medicare and Social

Security Sunset I'm not saying it's a

majority

[Applause]

[Music]

let me give you anybody who doubts it

attack my office I'll give you a copy

I'll give you a copy of The Proposal

that means Congress doesn't vote

well I'm glad to see you now I tell you

I enjoy conversion

first doesn't keep the programs the way

they are they'd go away other

Republicans say I'm not saying it's a

majority of you I don't even think it's

even a significant

[Music]

but it's being proposed by individuals

I'm not politely not naming them but

it's being proposed by some of you

look folks

the idea is that we're not going to be

we're not going to be moved into being

threatened to default on the debt if we

don't respond

folks

so folks as we all apparently agree

Social Security Medicare is off the off

the books now right

all right

we got unanimity

Social Security Medicare or Lifeline for

millions of seniors Americans have to

pay into them from the very first

paycheck they started so tonight let's

all agree and apparently are let's stand

up for seniors

stand up and show them

will not cut Social Security we will not

cut Medicare

those benefits belong to the American

people they earned it and if anyone

tries to cut Social Security which

apparently no one's going to do

and if anyone tries if it's got Medicare

I'll stop them I'll veto it

and look I'm not going to allow them to

take away be taken away not today not

tomorrow not ever but apparently it's

not going to be a problem

next month when I offer my fiscal plan I

asked my Republican friends to lay down

their plan as well

I really mean it let's sit down together

and discuss our mutual plans together

let's do that

I can tell you

the plan I'm going to show you're going

to cut the deficit by another two

trillion dollars

and I won't cut a single bit of Medicare

or self-security in fact we're going to

extend the Medicare trust fund at least

two decades because that's going to be

the next argument how do we make keep it

solvent right

well will not raise tax anyone making

under 400 Grand but

will pay for it the way we talked about

by making sure that the wealthy and big

corporations pay their fair share look

look

they're not just taking advantage of the

tax code they're taking advantage you

the American Consumer here's my message

to all of you out there I have your back

we're already preventing Americans and

receiving surprise medical bills so

stopping one billion dollar surprise

bills per month so far

we're protecting

seniors life savings

by cracking down in nursing homes that

commit fraud endanger patient safety

prescribe drugs that are not needed

millions of Americans can now save

thousands of dollars because they can

finally get a hearing aid over the

counter without a prescription

[Applause]

it's exploitation

last year I cracked down with the help

of many of you on foreign shipping

companies that were making you pay

higher prices for every good coming in

the country I signed a bipartisan bill

of cut shipping cost by 90 percent

helping American farmers businessmen and

consumers let's finish the job

pass the bipartisan legislation of

strength and strengthen and Trust

enforcement and for big and prevent big

online platforms giving their own

products an unfair advantage

my Administration is also taking on junk

fees

those hidden surcharges too many

companies use to make you pay more for

example we're making Airlines show you

the full ticket price up front

refund your money if your flight is

canceled or delayed we reduce exorbitant

Bank overdrafts by Saving consumers more

than one billion dollars a year

for cutting credit card late fees by 75

percent from thirty dollars to eight

dollars

look

junk fees

may not matter to the very wealthy but

they matter to most other folks in homes

like the one I grew up in like many of

you did they add up to hundreds of

dollars a month

they make it harder for you to pay your

bills and afford that family trip

I know how unfair it feels when a

company overcharges you and gets away

with it not anymore

we've written a bill to stop it all it's

called the junk fee prevention Act

we're going to ban surprise Resort fees

that hotels charge on your bill those

fees can cost up to ninety dollars a

night in hotels that aren't even resorts

we the idea

I did the cable internet and cell phone

companies can charge you 200 or more if

you decide to switch another provider

give me a break

we can stop service fees on tickets to

concerts and sporting events and make

companies disclose all the fees up front

and will prohibit Airlines from charging

50 round trip for family just to be able

to sit together

these fees are bad enough

[Applause]

teach your child like a piece of baggage

they're being played for suckers

so fast

the jump 3 prevention act so companies

stop ripping us off

for too long

workers have been getting stiffed but

not anymore

we're getting we're beginning to restore

the Dignity of work

for example

I I should have known this but I didn't

until two years ago

30 million workers have to sign

non-compete agreements

through the jobs they take 30 million

so a cashier

at a burger place can't walk across town

and take the same job another burger

place and make a few bucks more the

chess chain but they just changed it

because we exposed it

that was part of the deal guys look it

up

but not anymore

we're Banning those agreements so

companies have to compete for workers

and pay them what they're worth

and I must tell you

this is bound to get a response from my

friends on my left but the right

I'm so sick and tired of companies

breaking the law by preventing workers

from organizing pass the pro Act

[Applause]

for you you

let's guarantee all workers have a

living wage

let's make sure working parents can

afford to raise a family with sick days

paid family medical leave

affordable child care

that's going to enable millions of more

people to go and stay at work and let's

restore the full child tax credit

which gave tens of millions of parents

on breeding room and cut child poverty

in half to the lowest level in history

and by the way when we do all these

things we increase productivity we

increase economic growth so let's finish

the job

and get more families access to

affordable quality housing let's get

seniors who want to stay in their homes

the care they need to do so

let's get more breathing room to

millions of family caregivers looking

after their loved ones

past my plan so we get seniors and

people with disabilities the home care

and services they need

and support

the workers who are doing God's work

these plans are fully paid for and we

can afford to do them

restoring the Dignity of work means

making education an affordable ticket to

the middle class

you know when we made public education

12 years of it Universal in the last

century

we made the best educated best paid we

became the best educated best paid

nation in the world

but the rest of us caught up

it's caught up

Jill my wife who teaches full time has

an expression

I hope I get it right kid

any nation that out educates us is going

to out-compete us Any Nation out

education can now compete us folks we

all know 12 years of education is not

enough to win the economic competition

of 21st century

you want to have the best educated

Workforce let's finish the job

by providing access to preschool for

three and four years old

studies show that children to go to

preschool are nearly 50 percent more

likely to finish high school and go on

to earn a two or four year degree no

matter their background they came from

let's give Public School teachers a

raise

thank you

we're making progress

by reducing student debt increasing Pell

Grants for working in Middle Class

families let's finish the job

and connect students to career

opportunities starting in high school

provide access to two years of Community

College the best career training in

America in addition to being a pathway

to a four-year degree

let's offer every American a path to a

good creation whether they go to college

or not

to folks

folks in the midst of the kova crisis

schools were closed

and we were shutting down everything

let's recognize how far we came in the

fight against the pandemic itself

while the virus is not gone thanks to

the resilience of the American people

and the Ingenuity of Medicine

we've broken the cover grip on us

covered deaths were down by 90 percent

we've saved millions of lives and opened

up

our country we opened our country back

up and soon we'll end the public health

emergency

but

that's called a public health emergency

but we'll remember the toll and pain is

never going to go away

more than a million Americans lost their

lives to covet a million

families grieving

children and orphaned

Empty Chairs the dining room table

constantly reminding you

that she used to sit there

remembering them

we remain vigilant

we still need to monitor dozens of

variants and support new vaccines and

treatments so Congress needs to fund

these efforts and keep America safe

and as we emerge from this crisis

stronger

we're also got to double down on

Prosecuting criminals who stole relief

money meant to keep workers in small

businesses

before I came to office you remember

during that campaign the big issue is

about inspector generals

who would protect taxpayers dollars and

were sidelined

they were fired

many people said we don't need them

and fraud became rampant

last year I told you the Watchdogs are

back

since then since then we've recovered

billions of taxpayers dollars now let's

triple the anti-fraud strike force going

after these criminals double the statute

of limitations on these crimes and

cracked down on identity fraud by

criminal syndicates stealing billions of

dollars billions of dollars from the

American people

and the data showed that for every

dollar we put in the fighting fraud the

taxiers get back at least 10 times as

much it matters it matters

look

cover left his scars

like the spike in violent crime in 2020.

the first year of the pandemic

we have an obligation to make sure all

people are safe

Public Safety depends on public trust as

all of us know

too often that trust is violated

join us tonight are the parents of Tyree

Nichols

welcome

I had to bury Tyree last week

as many of you personally know

there's no word to describe the heart

acre brief of losing a child

but imagine

if you lost that child at the hands of

the law

imagine

having to worry whether your son or

daughter came home from walking down the

street

playing in the park or just driving a

car

most of us in here

have never had to have the talk

the talk that brown and black parents

have had to have with their children Bo

Hunter Ashley my children

I never had to ever talk with them

I never had to tell them if a police

officer pulls you over

turn your interior lights on right away

don't reach your license

keep your hands on the steering wheel

imagine having to worry like that every

single time

your kid got in a car

here's what tyree's mother shared with

me when I spoke to her

when I asked her how she finds the

courage to carry on and speak out

the faith of God she said her son was

quote a beautiful soul

and something good will come of this

imagine how much courage and character

that takes

it's up to us to all of us

we all want the same thing

neighborhoods free of violence

law enforcement law enforcement earned

the community's trust

just as every cop when they pin on that

badge in the morning has a right to be

able to go home at night

so does everybody else out there

our children

have a right to come home safely

equal protection

under the law

we have we with each other in America

we know

police officers put their lives on the

line every single night and day

and we know we ask them in many cases to

do too much to be counseling social

workers psychologists responding to drug

overdoses mental health crises and so

much more

in one sense we asked much too much of

them

I know most cops and their families are

good decent honorable people the vast

majority

and they risk their lives every time

they put that shield on

but what happened to Tyree in Memphis

happens too often

we have to do better

give law enforcement the real training

they need

hold them to higher standards

help them succeed in keeping us safe

we also need more first respondents and

professionals to address the growing

mental health substance abuse challenges

more resources reduce violent crime and

gun crime

more Community intervention programs

more investment in housing education and

job training

all this can help prevent violence in

the first place

when police officers

police departments violate the public

Trust they must be held accountable

with the support

to this report

of the families of victims

civil rights groups and law enforcement

I signed an executive order for all

federal officers

Banning chokeholds restricting no knock

warrants another key elements of the

George Floyd Act

let's commit ourselves to make the words

of Tyler's mom true

something good must come from this

something good

and all of us

all of us

folks it's difficult but it's simple all

of us in the chain in this chamber we

need to rise to this moment

we can't turn away

let's do what we know in our hearts

that we need to do

let's come together to finish the job on

police reform

do something do something

that was a plea of parents who lost

their children in Uvalde I met with

every one of them

do something about gun violence

thank God

thank God we did

passing the most sweeping gun safety law

three decades

that includes things like

that the majority of responsible gun

owners already support

enhanced background checks for 18 to 21

years old red flag laws keeping guns out

of the hands of people are a danger to

themselves and others

but we know our work is not done

join us tonight is Brandon say a 26 year

old hero Brandon put his college dreams

on hold to beat his mom's side his mom's

side when she was dying from cancer

Brandon

Brandon now works at the dance studio

started by his grandparents

two weeks ago

during the Lunar New Year celebrations

you heard the studio door closed you saw

a man standing there pointing

semi-automatic pistol atom

he thought he was going to die

but he thought about the people inside

and that instant he found the courage to

act and wrestle the semi-automatic

pistol away from the gunman who had

already killed 11 people in another

Dance Studio

11.

he saved lives

it's time we do the same band of Soul

weapons now ban them now

watching for all

I love the fight to do that in 1994.

when

in 10 years that band was law mass

shootings went down after we let it

expire in the Republican Administration

mass shootings tripled let's finish the

job and ban these assault weapons

and let's also come together on

immigration

make it a bipartisanitary once again

we know we now have a record number of

personnel working to secure the Border

arresting eight thousand human Smugglers

seizing over 23 000 pounds of fentanyl

in just the last several months

we've launched a new border plan last

month

unlawful migration from Cuba Haiti

Nicaragua and Venezuela has come down 97

as a consequence of that

when American Border problems won't be

fixed until Congress Acts if we don't

pass my comprehensive immigration reform

at least passed my plan to provide the

equipment and officers to secure the

Border

thank you

and a pathway to citizenship for

dreamers those on temporary status Farm

Workers essential workers

here in the people's house

it's our duty to protect all the

people's rights and freedoms

Congress must restore the right and the

Congress must restore the right

that was taken away

in Roe v Wade and protect Roe v Wade

[Music]

the vice president and I are doing

everything

exact access to reproductive health care

and Safeguard patient safety but already

more than a dozen states are enforcing

extreme abortion bans make no mistake

about it if Congress passes a national

ban I will veto it

but let's also pass

it's also passed the bipartisan

inequality act to ensure LPG lgbtq

Americans especially transgender young

people can live with safety and dignity

our strength

our strength is not just the example of

our power but the power of our example

let's remember the world's watching

I spoke in this chamber one year ago

just days after Vladimir Putin Unleashed

his brutal attack against Ukraine a

murderous assault evoking images of

death and destruction Europe suffered in

World War II

Putin's Invasion has been a test

for the ages test for America test for

the world

would we stand for the most basic of

principles

will we stand for sovereignty we stand

for the right of people to live free of

tyranny

will we stand for the defense of

democracy

for such defense matters to us because

it keeps peace and prevents Open Season

and would be aggressive and threatens

our prosperity

one year later

we know the answer yes we would and we

did we did

together

we did what America always does at our

best we LED

we United NATO we build a global

coalition

we stood against Putin's aggression

we stood with Ukrainian people to deny

we're once again joined by ukrainian's

ambassador to the United States she

represents not her and just our nation

but the courage of her People ambassador

as our ambassador is here

United we're in uniting our support of

your country when you stand so we can

all take a look at you

because we're going to stand with you

as long as it takes

our nation's working for more freedom

more dignity more more peace not just in

Europe but everywhere

before I came to office the story was

about how the People's Republic of China

was increasing its power

and America was failing in the world

not anymore

we made clear and I made my personal

conversation which have been many with

President XI that we seek competition

not conflict

but I will make no apologies

that we're investing and to make America

stronger investing in American

innovation and industries will Define

the future that China intends to be

dominated

investing in our alliances and working

with our allies to protect Advanced

Technologies so they will not be used

against us modernizing our military to

safeguard stability and determine to

deter aggression today we're the

strongest position in decades to compete

with China or anyone else in the world

anywhere else in the world

and I'm committed

I'm committed to work with China where

we can advance American interest and

benefit the world but make no mistake

about it

as we made clear last week if China

threatens our sovereignty we will act to

protect our country and we did

let's be clear when in the competition

should unite all of us

we Face serious challenges across the

world

but in the past two years democracies

have become stronger not weaker

autocracy has grown weaker not stronger

name me a world leader

who changed places with Xi Jinping name

me one

name me one

America's rally in the world to meet

those challenges from climate to Global

Health to food insecurity to terrorism

to territorial aggression

allies are stepping up spending more and

doing more

look

the bridges were forming between

partners in the Pacific and those in the

Atlantic

and those who bet against America are

learning how wrong they are it's never

ever been a good bet to bet against

America never

wow

when I came to office most assured the

bipartisanship assumed was impossible

but never believed it that's why a year

ago I offered a Unity agenda to the

nation as I stood here we made real

progress together

we passed the law and make it easy for

doctors to prescribe effective

treatments for opioid addiction

we passed

for gun safety law making historic

investments in mental health

we launched the arpa H drive for

breakthrough in the fights against

cancer Alzheimer's and diabetes and so

much more

[Applause]

in fact named after the late Iraq war

veteran whose story about exposure to

toxic burn kits I shared here last year

I understand something about those burn

pits but there's so much more to do

we can do it together

join us tonight is a father named Doug

from Newton New Hampshire

he wrote Jill my wife a letter and me as

well

about as courageous daughter Courtney

a contagious laugh

his sister's best friend her sister's

best friend

he shared the story all too familiar to

millions of Americans and many of you in

the audience

Courtney discovered pills in high school

it spiraled into addiction

and eventually death from a fentanyl

overdose

she was just 20 years old

describing the last eight years without

her Doug said

there's no worse pain

if their families turned pain to purpose

working to end the stigma and change

laws

he told us he wants to start a journey

toward American Recovery

dog her with you

fentanyl is killing more than 70 000

Americans a year

[Applause]

you got it

[Applause]

so let's launch a major surge to stop

fentanyl production in the sale and

trafficking with more drug detection

machines inspection cargo stop pills and

powder at the border

working with curry is like FedEx to

expect more packages for drugs

strong penalties to crack down and fend

all traffic

let's do more mental health especially

for our children when millions of young

people are struggling with bullying

violence trauma we're them greater

access to Mental Health Care at their

schools

we must finally hold social media

companies accountable for experimenting

or doing running children for profit

there's time to pass bipartisan

registration to stop big Tech from

collecting personal data on our kids and

teenagers online

fan targeted advertising their children

and impose stricter limits on the

personal data that companies collect on

all of this

third

must do more to keep this nation's ones

fully sacred obligation

to equip those we send into Harm's Way

and care for them and their families

when they come home

job training job placement for veterans

and their spouses as they come to return

to civilian life helping veterans afford

the rent because no one should be

homeless in America especially someone

who served the country

foreign

we had our first real discussion when I

asked him to take the job I'm glad he

did

we were losing up to 25 veterans a day

on suicide

now we're losing 17 today to the silent

scourge of suicide 17 veterans a day

are committing suicide

more than all the people being killed in

the wars

folks VA is doing everything it can

including expanding mental health

screening

proven programs of recruits veterans to

help other veterans understand what

they're going through

get them the help they need

we got to do more

and fourth

last year Jill and I reignited the

cancer moonshot that I was able to start

with President Obama asked me to lead

our Administration on this issue

our goal is to cut the cancer death

rates

at least by 50 in the next 25 years

turn more Cancers and death sentences to

treatable diseases

provide more support for patients and

their families

it's personal to so many of us so many

of us in this audience

joining us

are Morris and Candice

an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants

from Panama

they met and fell in love in New York

City and got married in the same Chapel

Jill and I got married in New York City

Kindred Spirits he wrote us a letter

about his little daughter Ava

and I saw her just before I came over

she was just a year old when she was

diagnosed with rare kidney disease

cancer

after 26 blood transfusions

11 rounds of radiation eight rounds of

Keno chemo

one kidney removed

giving a five percent survival rate

he wrote how in the darkest moments he

thought if she goes I can't stay

many of you been through that as well

Jillian I understand that like so many

of you

he read Jill's book describing our

family's cancer Journey

and how we tried to steal moments of Joy

where we could with both

for them that glimmer of Joy was the

half smile

of their baby girl

it meant everything

they never gave up hope

little Ava never gave up hope

she turns four next month

they just found out

his beating the odds is on her way to

being cured of cancer

and she's watching from the White House

tonight if she's not asleep already

for the lives we can save

for the lives we can say in the lives

we've lost

let this be a truly American moment that

rallies the country in the world

together

prove that we can still do big things

20 years ago under the leadership of

President Bush

and countless Advocates and champions he

undertook a bipartisan effort through

pepfar to transform the global fight

against HIV AIDS it's been a huge

success he thought big he thought large

he moved

I believe we can do the same thing with

cancer

let's end cancer as we know it

sure some cancers

once and for all

folks

there's one reason why we've been able

to do all of these things

our democracy itself

it's the most fundamental thing of all

with democracy everything's possible

without it nothing is

the last few years our democracy has

been threatened and attacked put at risk

put to the test In This Very Room on

January the 6th

and then just a few months ago

an unhinged big lie

a sale and Unleashed a political

violence the home of the then Speaker of

the House Representatives

using the very same language the

insurrectionists used as they stalk

these Halls Enchanted on January 6th

here tonight in this chamber is a man

who Bears the scars of that brutal

attack

but it's as tough and as strong as

resilient as they get my friend Paul

Pelosi Paul Stanley

thank you

it's such a heinous act should have

never happened

we must all speak out

there's no place for political violence

in America we have to protect the right

to vote not suppress the fat fundamental

right honor the results of our elections

not subvert the will of people we have

to uphold the rule of law and restore

trust in our institutions of democracy

and we must give hate and extremism in

any form no Safe Harbor

[Applause]

let's not be a partisan issue

it's an American issue

every generation American has faced a

moment where they haven't been called to

protect our democracy defendants stand

up for it

and this is our moment

my fellow Americans

we meet tonight at an inflection point

one of those moments

than only a few Generations ever face

with the direction

we now take is going to decide the

course of this nation for decades to

come

we're not bystanders of History

we're not powerless before the forces

that confront us

it's within our power of We the People

we're facing the test of our time

we have to be the nation we've always

been at our best optimistic hopeful

forward-looking a nation that Embraces

of light over dark

hope over fear you never do the

stability over chaos

we have to see each other not as enemies

but as fellow Americans

we're good people the only nation in the

world built on an idea the only one

other nations

are defined by geography ethnicity

[Applause]

but we're the only nation based on an

idea

that all of us

every one of us is created equal in the

image of God

a nation that stands as a beacon of the

world

a nation

and a new age of possibilities

so I've come to

fulfill my constitutional obligation to

report in the state of the union and

here's my report

because the soul of this nation is

strong

because the backboken backbone of this

nation is strong because the people of

this nation are strong the state of the

union is strong

thank you

I'm not new to this place I stand you

tonight having served as long as about

any one of you who've ever served here

but I've never been more optimistic

about our future about the future

America just to remember who we are

capacity if we do it together God bless

you all and may God protect our truth
